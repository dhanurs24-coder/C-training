GRAPH:-

Collection of vertex and edge 
         Two types of graph:
            Directed graph: edges have direction
            Undirected graph: edges do not have direction
All trees are graphs, but not all graphs are trees.

Two common ways to represent a graph:
   1. Adjacency Matrix

   2. Adjacency List
